                            <li>1. Public : Class,Method,Field is accessible from anywhere.</li>
                           <li> 2. Protected:Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong or from the
                                    sub-classes,and from the class of same package,but not from outside.</li>

                            of itâ€™s native package.</li>

                        When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a
class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method
or variable shared for all objects.

                    <td> 
                        <li> Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and
                            methods in a single unit.</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as
                            each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other
                            objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose. </li>

                    <td>
                        <li>A singleton class in java can have only one instance and hence all its methods and variables belong
                            to just one instance. Singleton class concept is useful for the situations when there is a need to
                            limit the number of objects for a class. </li>

                                connection to a database due to some driver limitations or because of any licensing issues.

                    <td> What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?</td>
                    <td>
                        <li>Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly.
                            There are three types of loops in Java: </li>
                        <li>For Loops<br>
                            For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops
                            are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer. </li>
                        <li>While Loops <br>
                            While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is
                            fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements. </li>
                        <li>  Do While Loops <br>
                            Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution
                            of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.</li>

                            by defining any breaking logic in the body of the statement blocks. </li>
