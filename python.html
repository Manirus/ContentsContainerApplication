                <td><li>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
                    Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries.
                     Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management 
                    which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems. </li>
                    <li><b>Benefits of using Python:</b></li>
                    <li> Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes
                         readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, 
                         the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.
                    </li>
                    <li>Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community
                         of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.</li>

                <td>What is a dynamically typed language? </td>
                <td><li>
                    Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. 
                    Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. 
                    In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, "1" + 2 will result in a type error since these 
                    languages don't allow for "type-coercion" (implicit conversion of data types).
                     On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output "12" as result.
                </li>
            <li> Type-checking can be done at two stages -</li>
            <li> <b>Static</b>Data Types are checked before execution.</li>
            <li> <b> Dynamic</b>Data Types are checked during execution.
                Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking 
                is done on the fly, during execution. 
                Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.</li>

                <td> An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line.
                     Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. 
                     Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code,
                     with no intermediary compilation step.</td>

                <td> PEP stands for <b>Python Enhancement Proposal</b>. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the 
                    Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.</td>

                <td> What is Scope in Python?</td>
                <td> <li>Every object in Python functions within a scope.
                     A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. 
                     Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. 
                     However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects 
                     without any prefix.
                     A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows:
                </li>
                <li>A <b>local scope </b>refers to the local objects available in the current function.</li>
                <li>A<b> global scope</b>refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception. </li>
                <li>A <b>module-level scope </b> refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program.</li>
                <li>An <b> outermost scope</b>refers to all the built-in names callable in the program. 
                    The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced.</li>

                <td> Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. 
                    The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. 
                    Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], 
                    while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97).</td>

                <td>What are the common built-in data types in Python? </td>
                <td> There are several built-in data types in Python.
                     Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations 
                     type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each 
                     other are neglected. 
                     Python provides type() and isinstance() functions to check the type of these variables.
                     These data types can be grouped into the following categories-</td>

                        With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.
                         It binds the attributes with the given arguments. 
                         self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword. 
                        But unlike in C++, self is not a keyword in Python.</td>

                    <td>What are Python namespaces? Why are they used? </td>
                    <td> 

                        <li>A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without 
                            any conflict.
                             Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a 
                             corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same 
                             name and map it to a separate object.
                             A few examples of namespaces are as follows: </li>
                             <li> <b>Local Namespace</b> includes local names inside a function. 
                                the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.</li>
                                <li><b> Global Namespace</b> includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in 
                                    the current project. This namespace is
                                     created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.</li>
                                <li><b>Built-in Namespace </b>includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for 
                                    various types of exceptions.
                                    <b>The lifecycle of a namespace</b> depends upon the scope of objects they are mapped to.
                                     If the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace comes to an end.
                                     Hence, it isn't possible to access inner namespace objects from an outer namespace. </li>

                    <td>What is pickling and unpickling? </td>
                    <td> <li> 
                        Python library offers a feature - serialization out of the box. 
                        Serializing an object refers to transforming it into a format that can be stored, 
                        so as to be able to deserialize it,
                         later on, to obtain the original object. Here, the pickle module comes into play.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pickling:</b>
                        Pickling is the name of the serialization process in Python. 
                        Any object in Python can be serialized into a byte stream and dumped as a file in the memory.
                         The process of pickling is compact but pickle objects can be compressed further.
                          Moreover, pickle keeps track of the objects it has serialized and the serialization 
                          is portable across versions.
                            The function used for the above process is pickle.dump().
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Unpickling:</b>
                        Unpickling is the complete inverse of pickling. 
                        It deserializes the byte stream to recreate the objects stored in the file and loads the object to memory.
                    </li>
                    <li> The function used for the above process is pickle.load().</li>
